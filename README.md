## Rules:

* Don’t copy any code from anywhere. Build your UI elements from scratch.
* Don’t use JavaScript unless you decide you absolutely need it.
* All UI elements must be responsive, but you can work on full responsiveness after the hackathon.
* You don’t have to complete the website during the hackathon. Try to build as many UI elements as possible first; if you have time to build the website or if you feel confident you can complete twenty elements and the website, do both.
* You must submit your project (a link to the GitHub repo and a link to a live webpage with the elements) before 9 p.m. EST on the last day of the hackathon.
* Don't use jQuery or any other library. You don't want to download a big library just to use a tooltip.
* Each team must submit at least two innovative elements; see the details below.
* Remember that each teammate must submit a writeup no later than 12 hours after you submit your project.

## Project Scope:

1. The Presentation Site needs to be responsive on all devices
2. To get familiar with the newest web features/technologies the idea is to use CSS Variables (detail soon)
3. Floobit is as a draft for pair programming (tbd)
4. ...
